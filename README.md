# Student Study Space

This project won <strong>THIRD PLACE</strong> for the Facebook Melbourne Hack in 2018.


The concept is a student study group website, which is run and managed by students.
Students are able to create and view chatrooms, resources, shared study notes, subject/teacher reviews, timetables and quizzes.
Students can also run the quizzes in the chatroom and compete to answer the questions the fastest.

Over the years, the study space will gather resources and become a good source of information for the unit with honest reviews and notes.


This project was made with React, Redux and Firebase
